# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enables automatic scraping of restaurant menus from their online sources and populating the database with structured menu item data. The system will identify available online menus for restaurants in the database, extract menu information, and store it in a standardized format for use in the application.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to scrape menu data from selected restaurant websites, so that our database contains up-to-date menu information for chosen restaurants.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a restaurant is selected for scraping AND has an online menu URL THEN the system SHALL attempt to scrape menu data from that URL
2. WHEN menu scraping is initiated for a restaurant THEN the system SHALL process only the selected restaurant
3. WHEN scraping is successful THEN the system SHALL store menu items with name, description, price, and category information
4. IF a restaurant's menu URL is inaccessible THEN the system SHALL log the error and report the failure
5. WHEN duplicate menu items are detected THEN the system SHALL update existing items rather than create duplicates

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to configure which restaurant websites can be scraped, so that the system only attempts to scrape from supported sources.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring menu scraping THEN the system SHALL support common restaurant website formats and menu platforms
2. WHEN encountering an unsupported website format THEN the system SHALL log a warning and skip that restaurant
3. IF a restaurant uses a supported menu platform THEN the system SHALL successfully extract menu data using appropriate parsing logic
4. WHEN adding new restaurant menu sources THEN the system SHALL allow configuration of custom scraping rules

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to monitor the menu scraping process, so that I can track success rates and identify issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN menu scraping runs THEN the system SHALL log the start and completion of the process
2. WHEN processing each restaurant THEN the system SHALL log success or failure status with details
3. WHEN scraping completes THEN the system SHALL provide a summary report of processed restaurants and menu items
4. IF errors occur during scraping THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information for troubleshooting
5. WHEN menu items are updated THEN the system SHALL track the timestamp of the last successful scrape

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to schedule automatic menu scraping for selected restaurants, so that menu data stays current without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring the system THEN the administrator SHALL be able to set up scheduled menu scraping jobs for specific restaurants
2. WHEN a scheduled scrape runs THEN the system SHALL process only the restaurants configured for that schedule
3. IF a scheduled scrape fails THEN the system SHALL send notifications to administrators
4. WHEN scheduling is configured THEN the system SHALL allow different frequencies for different restaurants based on their update patterns

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want menu scraping to handle rate limiting and respectful crawling, so that restaurant websites are not overloaded.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN scraping multiple restaurants THEN the system SHALL implement delays between requests to avoid overwhelming servers
2. WHEN encountering rate limiting THEN the system SHALL respect robots.txt files and implement exponential backoff
3. WHEN making requests THEN the system SHALL use appropriate user agent strings and headers
4. IF a website blocks the scraper THEN the system SHALL log the issue and continue with other restaurants

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As an application user, I want to view scraped menu items for restaurants, so that I can see current menu offerings.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing a restaurant page THEN users SHALL see menu items organized by category
2. WHEN menu items are displayed THEN they SHALL show name, description, price, and last updated timestamp
3. IF no menu data is available THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate message
4. WHEN menu data is stale THEN the system SHALL indicate when the menu was last updated
